# Osmotic Consciousness Framework (OCF)

## Overview

The Osmotic Consciousness Framework (OCF) is an innovative theoretical model that conceptualizes consciousness as a multi-layered, interconnected system with dynamic, semipermeable boundaries. This repository serves as a collaborative platform for developing, refining, and exploring the OCF.

## Forward

I am not a scientist. I am know qualified to do this work in any way. Nonetheless, this work is important to me, and I feel it isn't being done. Do with that what you will, I don't care.

I'd also like to note, exploring these concepts can be inherently distressing at times. Remain grounded, but embrace the unknown. 

As a friend of mine once said, "It's a bit like trying to read an infinite book -- no matter how much you read, there's always more."

## Problem statement

I believe we have a fundamental misunderstanding of consciousness, emotion, and cognition. This work is my attempt to explore that discontinuity from a green field perspective, and provide that work for others to take forward more scientifically.

## Key Concepts

The OCF integrates ideas from psychology, sociology, physics, and systems theory to provide a comprehensive view of consciousness across various scales. Key components include:

1. Multi-layered Consciousness Structures
2. Dynamic Boundary Characteristics
3. Nonlocal Interactions
4. Quantum-like Properties
5. Temporal Aspects
6. Critical Phenomena
7. Emergent Properties
8. Bidirectional Influence
9. Nested Interactions

## Repository Structure

- `/components`: Individual documents for each key component of the OCF
- `/applications`: Explorations of OCF applications in various fields
- `/models`: Computational models and simulations based on the OCF
- `/discussions`: Open-ended discussions and theoretical explorations
- `/resources`: Additional resources, references, and related works


## Project Ethos

While this project warmly welcomes contributions and diverse perspectives, the core vision and direction of the Osmotic Consciousness Framework remain under my stewardship. I am committed to maintaining the integrity of this work as it evolves. Valuable input is not just invited but essential; however, fundamental shifts in the framework's essence will be carefully considered and ultimately decided by me. This balance ensures that the OCF remains true to its original intent while benefiting from collective wisdom.
