## Non-Local Information Transfer Test Using Historical Discussions

### Objective
The purpose of this test is to investigate the possibility of non-local information transfer among humans. Specifically, the test aims to determine whether individuals can subconsciously access information from a nearby group of people engaged in a discussion, without any direct communication or sensory input.

### Test Setup
1. **Group of Veterans**:
   - Assemble a group of friendly veterans who will engage in casual conversations about historical events.
   - The veterans should have a strong background in history and naturally reference various historical facts during their discussion.

2. **Test Participants**:
   - In a nearby but isolated room, place a group of test participants who will be continuously tested on historical facts.
   - Ensure that the test room is soundproof and that participants have no access to any form of communication with the veterans.

3. **Room Configuration**:
   - The veterans' room and the test participants' room should be close enough to minimize external variables but completely isolated in terms of sound and visual contact.
   - The test participants should not be aware of the nature of the discussion happening in the veterans' room.

### Test Procedure
1. **Veterans' Discussion**:
   - Allow the veterans to engage in their discussion naturally, focusing on various historical topics, events, and figures.
   - Record the discussion for later analysis.

2. **Testing of Participants**:
   - Continuously present the test participants with multiple-choice questions, short answer questions, or other forms of historical fact queries.
   - Include questions that directly relate to the historical topics currently being discussed by the veterans.
   - Randomize the questions with others unrelated to the veterans' discussion to establish a control.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Record the participants' answers, along with the timing of each response, to correlate with the timing of the veterans' discussion.
   - Track any patterns in correct answers that align with the timing of the discussion topics.

### Metrics for Analysis
- **Correlation Between Discussion and Answers**: Analyze whether there is a statistically significant correlation between the historical facts discussed by the veterans and the correct answers provided by the test participants.
- **Random vs. Relevant Accuracy**: Compare the accuracy of answers related to the veterans' discussion with the accuracy of unrelated control questions.
- **Timing Analysis**: Examine whether participants are more likely to answer correctly shortly after the veterans discuss a relevant topic.

### Expected Outcomes
- If non-local information transfer exists, participants may show a higher-than-random accuracy in answering questions related to the veterans' discussion.
- The timing of correct answers may align closely with the timing of the discussion, suggesting a potential subconscious transfer of information.

### Applications
- This test could provide insights into unexplored aspects of human cognition and potential non-local connections.
- Further research based on the outcomes could explore applications in fields like communication, psychology, and neuroscience.
