## Intuition Measurement Test from Near-Miss Accident Videos

### Objective
The goal of this test is to measure and analyze intuition-based decision-making by observing participants' reactions to YouTube videos featuring near-miss accidents. The test aims to quantify the participants' ability to anticipate and react to potential dangers, evaluating their intuition and predictive capabilities.

### Test Setup
1. **Video Selection**:
   - Curate a collection of YouTube videos that feature near-miss accidents (e.g., traffic incidents, sports, or industrial settings).
   - Ensure the videos are diverse in context, length, and scenario to provide a broad assessment of intuitive responses.

2. **Participant Selection**:
   - Recruit participants with varying levels of experience in the contexts shown (e.g., drivers, athletes, industrial workers).
   - Include a control group with no specific experience in the scenarios presented.

3. **Test Procedure**:
   - Present each video to the participants one by one.
   - Before playing each video, ask participants to predict the outcome based on the initial few seconds.
   - During the video, monitor the participants' reactions, focusing on:
     - Anticipation of the near-miss event.
     - Verbal or non-verbal cues indicating recognition of danger.
     - Any intuitive actions or suggestions made by the participant.
   - After each video, ask participants to explain their thought process and reasoning behind their predictions.

4. **Data Collection**:
   - Record the participants' predictions and compare them with the actual outcomes.
   - Note the reaction time from when the danger becomes apparent to when the participant acknowledges it.
   - Collect qualitative data on participants' reasoning and intuitive thought processes.

### Metrics for Analysis
- **Prediction Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions made by the participants.
- **Reaction Time**: The time taken by participants to recognize and react to the impending danger.
- **Intuitive Reasoning**: Analysis of the qualitative data to identify common patterns in intuitive thinking.
- **Experience Correlation**: Comparison of intuition accuracy and reaction time across participants with varying levels of relevant experience.

### Expected Outcomes
- Participants with more experience in the scenario contexts are expected to have faster and more accurate intuitive responses.
- The test will help identify common traits among individuals with high intuition, providing insights into how intuition develops and functions under pressure.

### Applications
- This test can be used to enhance training programs by focusing on developing intuition in critical situations.
- The results can contribute to the understanding of human cognition and decision-making in high-stress environments.
